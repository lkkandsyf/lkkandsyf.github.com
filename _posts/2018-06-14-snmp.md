SNMP is one of the most commonly used technologies when it comes to network monitoring.

## SNMP MIB

MIB stands for Management Information Base and is a collection of information organized hierarchically. These are accessed using a protocol such as SNMP. There are two types of MIBs: scalar and tabular.

Scalar objects define a single object instance whereas tabular objects define multiple related object instances grouped in MIB tables.

MIBs are collections of definitions which define the properties of the managed object within the device to be managed.

MIB Example: The typical objects to monitor on a printer are the different cartridge states and maybe the number of printed files, and on a switch the typical objects of interest are the incoming and outgoing traffic as well as the rate of package loss or the number of packets addressed to a broadcast address.

SNMP OID
OIDs stands for Object Identifiers.  OIDs uniquely identify managed objects in a MIB hierarchy. This can be depicted as a tree, the levels of which are assigned by different organizations. Top level MIB object IDs (OIDs) belong to different standard organizations.

Vendors define private branches including managed objects for their own products.

Samples:
Here is a sample structure of an OID:


Iso(1).org(3).dod(6).internet(1).private(4).transition(868).products(2).chassis(4)
.card(1).slotCps(2)-cpsSlotSummary(1).cpsModuleTable(1).cpsModuleEntry(1)
.cpsModuleModel(3).3562.3

or just:
```c
1.3.6.1.4.868.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.3.3562.3
```


These numbers are the ones used in PRTG when setting up custom sensors, in order to access the appropriate elements of the device that you want to monitor. OIDs are generally provided by the hardware manufacturers or can be found in so-called OID repositories, where collections of MIB trees and the corresponding OIDs can be accessed.


SNMP Basics
SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol and consists of three key components: managed devices, agents, and network-management systems (NMSs). A managed device is a node that has an SNMP agent and resides on a managed network. These devices can be routers and access server, switches and bridges, hubs, computer hosts, or printers. An agent is a software module residing within a device. This agent translates information into a compatible format with SNMP. An NMS runs monitoring applications. They provide the bulk of processing and memory resources required for network management.
